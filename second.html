      My Love,<br><br>

      Loving you is the most beautiful thing that has ever happened to me.
      You are the warmth in my cold days, the light in my darkest nights,
      and the peace my heart was always searching for.<br><br>

      Every laugh we share, every late-night conversation, every silent
      moment we spend together becomes a memory I treasure deeply.<br><br>

      With you, life feels softer, sweeter, and infinitely more meaningful.
      Wherever life leads us, my heart will always find its way back to you
      because you are not just my love… you are my home.
